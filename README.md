This script is able to copy the most recent files from a backup folder ceated with Microsoft Windows File History.

Using this PHP Script you'll be able to extract and clean from the timestamp in the filename all the files from a Microsoft Windows File History folder.

I recommend to use it on specific folder, not on the full backup if you have hundred thousands of files.

Just edit the PHP file to set the souce path (note the double backslash notation).
Example: d:\\FileHistory\\folder

Files will be copied to an "output" folder.
